## My personal CV (using Pandoc)

Not so many years ago, I wrote my first CV using the [ModernCV LaTeX template](https://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/moderncv/). I really like the output quality of LaTeX, but it is quite verbose and difficult to adapt for different purposes. Later, I learnt a little about the excellent [Pandoc project](http://pandoc.org/). Pandoc allows keeping my CV in Markdown and that is very practical for future needs. For the moment, I have made some minor changes to the barraq's [Pandoc-ModernCV](https://github.com/barraq/pandoc-moderncv) and I'm using it.

You can download a PDF version of this CV in
