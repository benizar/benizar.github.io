Yesterday, I wanted to extract several thumbnails for publishing in this website. I usually do this kind of tasks using Gimp. However, I think that I will need to do this too many times in the future. For this reason, I tried to do it using [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org) ... Now, I have decided that I really like it. According to its website, 

> ImageMagic is a software suite to create, edit, compose, or convert bitmap images. It can read and write images in a variety of formats (over 200) including PNG, JPEG, JPEG-2000, GIF, TIFF, DPX, EXR, WebP, Postscript, PDF, and SVG. Use ImageMagick to resize, flip, mirror, rotate, distort, shear and transform images, adjust image colors, apply various special effects, or draw text, lines, polygons, ellipses and BÃ©zier curves.

The functionality of ImageMagick is typically utilized from the command-line so, virtually, it can be exploded by programs written in any programming language. I tested the `convert` command to automate the following steps:

1. Convert the first page of a PDF to PNG.
2. Adjust the image quality.
3. Resize it (my PDFs are A4 format, so resizing to 10% is enough for a miniature).
4. Set the background colour.
5. Add a thin black border.
6. Save the miniature into the images folder.
7. Use a loop for batch processing.

For example, this is the code used to prepare one of the miniatures included in the CV section of this website: 

``` bash
convert -density 300 -resize %10 \
        -background white -alpha remove -bordercolor black -border 1 \
        download/curriculum_eng.pdf[0] images/curriculum_eng.png
```

The following image is the result of processing [PDF]({{ site.url }}/download/cvn_english.pdf)

![cvn_english]({{ site.url }}/images/cvn_english.png){: .align-left}

The `convert` command can be used to *convert* between image formats as well as resize an image, blur, crop, despeckle, dither, draw on, flip, join, re-sample, and much more. See the [Command Line Processing](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/command-line-processing.php) documentation for learning more about its possibilities.

Sometimes, I need to process image files for accomplishing different tasks (watermarks, resizing, crop, convert to grayscale, etc). In the future, I will commit such new scripts [here]({{ site.url }}/images/convert_commands.md).

I hope you enjoyed this post ;)
